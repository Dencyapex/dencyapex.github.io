This case study demonstrates an example of some of the [Network attacks][1] or security issues companies experience that may likely prevent their customer from accessing the company’s website. We will  identify the likely cause of the service interruption. Then, we will explain how the attack occurred and the negative impact such occurrences have on the website.

## Case Study Scenario

As a security analyst for a travel agency that advertises sales and promotions on the company’s website. The employees of the company regularly access the company’s sales webpage to search for vacation packages their customers might like.

One afternoon, you receive an automated alert from your monitoring system indicating a problem with the web server. You attempt to visit the company’s website, but you receive a connection timeout error message in your browser.

You use a packet sniffer to capture data packets in transit to and from the web server. You notice a large number of TCP SYN requests coming from an unfamiliar IP address. The web server appears to be overwhelmed by the volume of incoming traffic and is losing its ability to respond to the abnormally large number of SYN requests. You suspect the server is under attack by a malicious actor. 

You take the server offline temporarily so that the machine can recover and return to a normal operating status. You also configure the company’s firewall to block the IP address that was sending the abnormal number of SYN requests. You know that your IP blocking solution won’t last long, as an attacker can spoof other IP addresses to get around this block. You need to alert your manager about this problem quickly and discuss the next steps to stop this attacker and prevent this problem from happening again. You will need to be prepared to tell your boss about the type of attack you discovered and how it was affecting the web server and employees.

*Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn't automatically save itself.*

## Basic formatting

Paragraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.

Paragraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.

## Lists

### Ordered list

1. Item 1
2. A second item
3. Number 3
4. Ⅳ

*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*

### Unordered list

* An item
* Another item
* Yet another item
* And there's more...

## Paragraph modifiers

### Code block

    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.

You can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.

### Quote

> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.

## Headings

There are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.

### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**

### They can even contain `inline code`

Of course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.

I don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.

## URLs

URLs can be made in a handful of ways:

* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.
* Another named link to [MarkItDown](https://www.markitdown.net/)
* Sometimes you just want a URL like <https://www.markitdown.net/>.

## Horizontal rule

A horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.

It's sometimes handy for breaking things up.

## Images

Markdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.

## Finally

There's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.
